### Design Constraints

_Specifies or constraints the system design process. Examples may include: programming languages, software process, mandatory standards/patterns, use of development tools, class library, etc._

### Implementation Constraints

_Specifies or constraints the code or construction of a system such
such as: mandatory standards/patterns, implementation languages,
database integrity, resource limits, operating system._


(fill in here)


### Interface Constraints
_Specifies or constraints the features inherent to the interaction of the
system being developed with other external systems._


(fill in here)

### Physical Constraints

_Specifies a limitation or physical requirement regarding the hardware used to house the system, as for example: material, shape, size or weight._
_**Probably talk about the weight or some pcÂ´s that are not able to handle the app.**_
