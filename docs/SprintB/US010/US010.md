### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Class1
* Class2
* Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* xxxxUI
* xxxxController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software
objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

![USXXX-SD](USXXX-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes
that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![USXXX-CD](USXXX-CD.svg)

# 4. Tests

*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of
requirements fulfilling.*

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in
accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of
other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 6. Integration and Demo

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features
of the system.*

# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to
other alternatives and or future related work.*
